 1.1 The Stream provides the following features:
 -----------------------------------------------
1. Stream does not store elements. 
   It simply conveys elements from a source such as a data structure, an array, or an I/O channel, through a pipeline of computational operations.

2. Stream is functional in nature. 
   Operations performed on a stream does not modify its source. For example, filtering a Stream obtained from a collection produces a new Stream without the filtered elements, rather than removing elements from the source collection.

3. Stream is lazy and evaluates code only when required.

4. The elements of a stream are only visited once during the life of a stream. Like an Iterator, a new stream must be generated to revisit the same elements of the source.
